# Markmap
This is just a basic demo on how to use [markmap](https://markmap.js.org/), I've find it very usefull when trying to present information. 

This file can be better visualized using the [markmap website](https://markmap.js.org/repl) or downloading the [VSCode markmap plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gera2ld.markmap-vscode)

# Things to remember
Official documentation is straight forward, but here are some things that might come in handy...

* You can define some configuration at the top of the file, all options are listed in [this link](https://markmap.js.org/docs/json-options)

* You can use the syntax `<!-- your comment here -->` to add comments.

* You can nest levels in the map by using identation.

* The VSCode plugin helps you export the map.
